# Version 2

We've [presented](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/icons8-lunacy-2-0) this version middle 2017. Lunacy version 2 didn't allow editing and served as a handoff tool. It allowed to view the documents, copy the CSS code, and export assets. 

# Version 1

After the meticulous testing with all kinds of Sketch files, we've launched Lunacy as a .sketch viewer. Two weeks after, version 43 came, completely changing the format. We had to rework it from scratch.
