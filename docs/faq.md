### Question: Will Lunacy work on Linux?

It’s definitely an option, although it requires additional development. If you’re willing to contribute, please check [this thread](https://lunatics.icons8.com/ideas/1/version-for-linux).

### Question: Do I need an internet connection to use Lunacy?

No, Lunacy doesn’t need to be connected to the internet.

### Question: How about going Open Source?

Short answer: Not at the moment, not all of it.

Long answer: Certainly, that would speed up the development.

On the other hand, it will slow it down too. Sometimes, a small team can advance more than a big community, especially in the beginning. We may reconsider it in the future.

If you are willing to contribute, you may want to create the interface for Linux. Check out [this thread](https://lunatics.icons8.com/ideas/1/version-for-linux).

### Question: How much are you planning to charge for Lunacy?

 Nothing. Lunacy is completely free (no hidden charges, no ads, no locked features).

### Q: How would I know when to update Lunacy?

The Windows Store version updates silently. If not, check that you [have](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/15081/windows-turn-on-automatic-app-updates) automatic updates on. We recommend this option.

### Q: Once there are updates, will I have to reinstall Lunacy, or do they install automatically?

If you installed Lunacy with a downloadable installer, it will notify you about the update with an alert in the window title.

Either way, you can check out our [release notes](https://docs.icons8.com/release-notes/).
