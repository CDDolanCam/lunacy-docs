# Support

* **[Community Support](https://community.icons8.com/)** — our forum. The whole development team is here to help you too.

* **[Feature Requests](https://lunatics.icons8.com/)** — a board similar to UserVoice. Vote for features and propose yours. One feature per post, please.

* **[Improving This Manual](https://github.com/icons8/lunacy-docs/blob/master/docs/index.md)** — please help us! We'll accept the pull requests for fixing the errors, expanding the sections, and updating it with new features (Icons8 team lags a little between adding a feature and writing the documentation for it). We'll also include the video tutorials covering certain features.

* **Saying hello** — our [Lunacy page](https://icons8.com/lunacy) has comments at the bottom. If you have a review of our work or just want to say hello, you’re welcome to do so!

* **[Lunacy in the Windows Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/lunacy/9pnlmkkpcljj)** — we depend on your honest feedback. Please vote and leave a review so more people will learn about Lunacy. Thank you 🙏🏽
