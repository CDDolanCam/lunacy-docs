## Editing or Translating an Existing Language

To edit a language that Lunacy already supports, use a service called [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/lunacy). 

1. You'll need to sign up or log in to your account.

2. To find our project, use search or follow the [direct link](https://crowdin.com/project/lunacy).

![Select an object and see its properties](public/localization_find_crowdin_project.png)

Use the language of localization which you want to edit or help to localize.

Use the search for quick navigation to the necessary value.

We also provided every value with a screenshot that shows where the text you work on can be found in the interface.

## Adding a New Language

If you want to add a localization language to Lunacy but it isn’t found in the Crowdin service, inform us via lunacy@icons8.com, and we will add it to Сrowdin, and after its localization, it will be included to the next release of Lunacy.
