## Editing or Translating an Existing Language

To edit a language that Lunacy already supports, use a service called [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/lunacy). 

1. You'll need to sign up or log in to your account.

2. To find our project, use search or follow the [direct link](https://crowdin.com/project/lunacy).

3. Choose the language which you want to edit or translate.

4. Search for a string in question.

## Adding a New Language

If you want to add a new language but it's not in our Crowdin project, drop us an email to lunacy@icons8.com. We will add it to Ð¡rowdin; after we're done with translation, we'll include it in the next release of Lunacy.
